### Approach:  
- I chose this problem statement as it aligned with my prior experience and offered an exciting challenge—integrating dynamic language translation using the Groq API for the first time.
- A major pivot came when redesigning the message flow to ensure translations passed through Groq before being stored. Brainstorming also led to improved prompt structures and optimizations in real-time communication for better performance.


### challenges I faced 
- Crafting effective prompts to ensure accurate and consistent responses from the Groq API was a significant challenge.
- Navigating the Groq documentation and understanding its implementation, especially as it was my first time integrating AI into a project.
- Building a robust real-time communication system posed architectural and technical hurdles.
- Optimizing frontend performance, particularly managing and minimizing unnecessary re-renders, required careful state management.
- Designing an efficient database schema was also a key challenge—I needed the translated messages to be processed through Groq before being stored, which added complexity to the data flow.
