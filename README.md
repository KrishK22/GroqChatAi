### Approach:  
- I chose this problem statement as it aligned with my prior experience and offered an exciting challenge‚Äîintegrating dynamic language translation using the Groq API for the first time.
- A major pivot came when redesigning the message flow to ensure translations passed through Groq before being stored. Brainstorming also led to improved prompt structures and optimizations in real-time communication for better performance.


### challenges I faced 
- Crafting effective prompts to ensure accurate and consistent responses from the Groq API was a significant challenge.
- Navigating the Groq documentation and understanding its implementation, especially as it was my first time integrating AI into a project.
- Building a robust real-time communication system posed architectural and technical hurdles.
- Optimizing frontend performance, particularly managing and minimizing unnecessary re-renders, required careful state management.
- Designing an efficient database schema was also a key challenge‚ÄîI needed the translated messages to be processed through Groq before being stored, which added complexity to the data flow.

## üèÅ Final Words


Started my journey in development in 1st semester and with days and night of dealing with lot of confusion, 404 error in my head 
it was difficult for me to sit for a project and complete it end-to-end facing new challenges .. to be honest hackazard exciting rewards helped 
me motivated throughout the hackathon timeline to deal with challenges and not to leave the project in between . 
It was exciting to be part of this event which led me get my first full stack project in my 1st year itself
